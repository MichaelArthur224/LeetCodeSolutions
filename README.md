# LeetCodeSolutions
Welcome to my collection of LeetCode solutions! This repository serves as a personal learning resource for understanding Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Each solution includes my thought process to provide insight into how I approached and solved the problem.

# Purpose

I created this repository to:
Deepen my understanding of DSA concepts through practice. Document my problem-solving thought process for future reference. Organize solutions by patterns to make it easier to identify techniques for specific problem types.

# Structure

Solutions are categorized by patterns, where each pattern corresponds to a specific type of problem or algorithmic technique (e.g., Two Pointers, Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms). This organization helps in recognizing and applying the appropriate approach to similar problems.

# How to Use

Browse the repository to find solutions grouped by pattern.
Each solution file includes:
The problem statement.
My approach and thought process.
The code implementation with comments.
Use the patterns to understand which techniques are best suited for different problem types.
